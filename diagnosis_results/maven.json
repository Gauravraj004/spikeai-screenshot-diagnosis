    "confidence": 0.95,
    "confidence_reasoning": "The screenshot shows a header and some initial content, but the majority of the page is blank, indicating a partial load. The HTML element count is zero, suggesting a JavaScript-rendered SPA that failed to load fully.",
    "visual_description": "The page displays a header with navigation links and a hero section with a title and a 'Book a demo' button. A cookie consent modal is visible, but the rest of the page is mostly blank, with large empty spaces.",
    "diagnosis": "The page appears to be a JavaScript-rendered SPA that did not load completely, resulting in a partial page load with missing main content.",
    "evidence": "Visible header and hero section, but the rest of the page is blank. The HTML analysis shows zero elements, indicating a likely JavaScript rendering failure.",
    "html_correlation": "The HTML structure shows zero elements, which aligns with the visual evidence of a partially loaded page. This suggests the page relies heavily on JavaScript for rendering.",
    "user_impact": "Users cannot access the main content of the page, leading to a poor user experience and inability to interact with the site as intended.",
    "root_cause": "The likely cause is a JavaScript error or a premature capture of the page before the JavaScript finished rendering.",
    "capture_improvement": "To prevent this issue, ensure the page is fully loaded by waiting for specific elements to appear before capturing."
