    "issue_type": "blank_page",
    "severity": "critical",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "confidence_reasoning": "The screenshot shows a completely blank page, which strongly indicates a rendering failure. The HTML analysis also shows 0 elements, suggesting a JavaScript-rendered SPA that failed to load content.",
    "visual_description": "The screenshot is entirely blank with no visible content, text, or images.",
    "diagnosis": "The page appears to be a Single Page Application (SPA) that relies on JavaScript to load content. The absence of any visible content suggests a failure in the JavaScript execution or a premature capture before the content loaded.",
    "evidence": "The screenshot is completely blank, and the HTML analysis indicates 0 elements, which is consistent with a rendering failure.",
    "html_correlation": "The HTML structure shows 0 elements, indicating that the page content is loaded via JavaScript. The blank screenshot suggests that the JavaScript did not execute properly or the capture was too early.",
    "user_impact": "Users will see a blank page, preventing them from accessing any content or functionality, leading to a poor user experience.",
    "root_cause": "The likely cause is a JavaScript error or a premature capture before the SPA content loaded.",
    "capture_improvement": "To prevent this issue, ensure that the capture waits for the JavaScript to fully execute and load the content."
